    <h2>> About Me</h2>

    <p>
        I am a cybersecurity student working toward my bachelor’s degree, focused on developing strong technical skills and real-world security experience. 
        I thrive in hands-on environments where I can take initiative, problem-solve, and learn by doing. My strengths in teamwork, adaptability, and staying 
        calm in chaotic situations help me excel under pressure — a valuable trait in cybersecurity. What makes me unique is my blend of professionalism and 
        approachability; I’m kind, polite, and bring a positive, humorous energy while still taking my work seriously. I want to be known as a dependable, 
        skilled cybersecurity professional who goes above and beyond to understand threats, protect systems, and help others.
